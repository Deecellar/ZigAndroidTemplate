# Android Apps in Zig

This repository contains a example on how to create a minimal Android app in Zig.

## State of the project
Right now, it's a stripped down version of [rawdrawandroid](https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid), containing only the required bits and pieces.
Please note that `build.zig` and `libc/` have hardcoded paths right now and will be changed to a configurable version later.

## Credits
Huge thanks to @cnlohr to create [rawdrawandroid](https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid) and making this project possible!
